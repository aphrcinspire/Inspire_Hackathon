#INSPIRE Hackathon 2024: Record Linkage Challenge



The Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) collaborates with over 15 Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) in 7 African countries. INSPIRE network is keen to devise novel means of improving record linkage at community level. Record linkage tools have the ability to identify a person who lives in the HDSS catchment area and link them to the social services that they receive in the community. The social services include health and education services in HDSS catchment area.  Effective record linkage to social services in HDSS communities has the following potential advantages;

1.     Ability to correlate household social characteristics with health seeking behavior

2.     Can identify early solutions to improve quality of life at household and community level

3.     Support the prediction of early warning epidemics at community level

4.     Correlate household demographic social characteristics with school attendance among children living in catchment area

5.     Support economic modelling and further estimation of the SDG indicators at community level

The INSPIRE network leverages experience from collaborating institutions to launch a competitive hackathon to design an innovative approach to record linkage in the HDSS. The team aims to explore the use of artificial intelligence tools and advances in machine learning algorithms to design a record linkage application or tool. We hypothesize the use of a tool that can identify a member of the HDSS when they seek health services with the community
